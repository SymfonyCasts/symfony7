# Setting up our Symfony App

Coming Soon...

Welcome to the Symfony 7 tutorial. My name is Ryan and I am so excited to be your guide through this entire series about Symfony, web development, and to hopefully help you love this stuff as much as I do. Symfony is actually a bunch of small reusable pieces called components that you can use in any PHP project. For example, there's one called Finder, which is just really good at finding files in different directories with different extensions. There's another component called Process, which you could pull into any PHP project to help you run processes. In this tutorial, we're going to focus on the Symfony framework. That's a collection of the components all glued together to feel like one thing so that we can get to work building faster. Now you can build anything with Symfony, whether that's a web app that returns HTML like you see here, or a pure API. In this tutorial series, we're going to build a web app. But if you're building a pure API, API Platform is a Symfony-based API framework that is absolutely incredible. So if you are building an API, follow the first few tutorials in this series, then pop over to our API Platform tutorials. But whatever you build, my goal is the same. I want you to be great at this stuff and love love doing it and become an even better developer. This course is about the basics, but we're going to get a lot of stuff working. The only prerequisite is that you is an understanding of PHP and object oriented principles. And we have tutorials on both. All right, ready? Let's do this. Step one, head to symphony.com slash download. On this page, you're going to find instructions on how to download a standalone binary called symphony. Now this is not symphony itself, it's just a little tool that's going to help you do things like start new symphony projects, run a local web server, and even if you want to deploy your application to production. Once you've downloaded, once you've downloaded and installed Once you've downloaded, once you've downloaded and installed it, open a terminal and move into any project on your system. To make sure that the symphony binary is working, I'll run symphony dash dash help to see the full list of all the commands that it does.  Don't worry, we're gonna use just a few of those to get things rocking. Before we start a project, run symphony check rec, which stands for check requirements. This is going to make sure that you have everything on your system that you need to run symphony like PHP, the correct version and PHP extensions. Once this is happy, start a new project with symphony new and then the name of a door and then the directory for your new project. I'll call mine star shop. By the way, this is going to give us a tiny project with only the base things installed. And then we're going to add more stuff little by little as we go along the way. Later when you feel comfortable with symphony, if you want to get started more quickly, you can run the same command with dash dash web app to get an app with much more stuff pre installed. Anyway, CD into the directories run CD run CD star shop to move into the directory and then ls to see our new project. We're going to get to know these files in the next chapter, but we already have a working symphony application. The only thing we need to do the only thing we need to see it. The only thing we have to do is start a local web server that points at this. And you can use any web server you want Apache Nginx caddy. But for local development, I highly recommend just using the symphony binary, you can run symphony serve inside this directory, and bam, you have a new local web server for our project running at 127.0.0.1 colon 8000. I'm gonna copy that, spin over, paste, and welcome to symphony seven. That's what I was gonna say. All right, let's get to know our tiny new app. Next.
